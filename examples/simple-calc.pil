~~ simple calculator

~~ user inputs numbers  
inp flt x "Enter your first number (x): "  
inp flt y "Enter your second number (y): "

~~ calculate and output answers  
out "x + y = " + (x + y)  
out "x - y = " + (x - y)  
out "x * y = " + (x * y)  
out "x / y = " + (x / y)  
out "x ^ y = " + (x ^ y)  
out "sqrt x = " + msqrt(x)  
out "sqrt y = " + msqrt(y)
